In Assignment 4, we had 3 questions(parts) to solve:

1) Implement Linear Regression without using Scikit-learn.
 
2) Implement Logistic Regression from scratch without using Scikit-learn. Run it against a 
dataset of choice (any dataset with over 1000 samples). Run the same algorithm with the help 
of Scikit learn. Compare your implementation with Scikit-learnâ€™s one. 

3) Make a dataset by yourself which should have enough samples and attributes and write 
documentation of it. Do classification or regression on it. If you want to do a classification task, 
implement at least five models. If you want to do regression, similarly at least five models need 
to be implemented. For each model get at least three performance metric scores. 
Implementation of cross validation is a must. (Name your dataset as Dataset_StudentId and 
upload here: shorturl.at/zBFH8)
